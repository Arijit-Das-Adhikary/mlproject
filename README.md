Rainfall Prediction System

Overview

The Rainfall Prediction System is a machine learning-based application designed to forecast rainfall using meteorological data. The system leverages Python and various data processing, feature selection, and model training techniques, including the Random Forest Classifier, to enhance predictive accuracy.

Features

Data preprocessing and cleaning

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for insights

Machine learning model training using Random Forest Classifier

Hyperparameter tuning for model optimization

Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix

Model deployment for real-time predictions

Technologies Used

 Python

 Pandas & NumPy (Data manipulation)

 Scikit-learn (Machine learning algorithms)

 Matplotlib & Seaborn (Visualization)

 Pickle (Model saving and loading)

 Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Arijit-Das-Adhikary/mlproject

Navigate to the project directory:

cd rainfall-prediction

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Train the Model

Run the following command to train the model:

python train_model.py

Make Predictions

Use the trained model to make predictions:

python predict.py --input_data "1015.9,19.9,95,81,0.0,40.0,13.7"

Data Preprocessing

Missing values handled using mode (categorical) and median (numerical)

Categorical values (Yes/No) mapped to binary (1/0)

Features selected based on correlation analysis

Model Training

Utilizes Random Forest Classifier

Hyperparameter tuning performed using GridSearchCV

Model performance evaluated with cross-validation

Evaluation Metrics

Accuracy: 85%

Precision & Recall: Analyzed with classification report

Confusion Matrix: Used for error analysis

ROC Curve: Evaluates modelâ€™s performance in distinguishing rainfall occurrences

Future Enhancements

Implement deep learning techniques (LSTMs, CNNs)

Incorporate satellite and radar-based data

Develop web or mobile applications for real-time predictions

Integrate live weather APIs for adaptive learning
